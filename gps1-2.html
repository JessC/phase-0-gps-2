     <h2>What is <span>Pair Programming</span>?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is a term used for when two people are working on the same program using the same terminal. One person acts as the driver and one as the navigator. The driver does all of the typing. The navigator gives direction while also reviewing the code that has just been typed. The roles are typically changed often. Pair programming can also be done remotely through screen sharing. Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"> Pair Programming</a> on Wikipedia.

     <h2>Why is <span>Pair Programming</span> important to DBC?</h2>
        <p>Right now, we are all just learning. Each of us are picking up different skills throughout the process. Pair programming is an excellent way to teach each other our unique abilities. And as shown in the diagram below, pair programming can cut down greatly on overall errors. Theres's also a better chance of devolping a higher quality product when two minds are working together.

        <h2>Compare <span>Driver</span> and <span>Navigator</span></h2>
        <p>Driver and Navigator are two different but equally important rolls in programming. The driver and navigator both work on the same project simultaneously. Frequent communication is very important. It's almost essential to think outloud so each person can follow the others thought process. Silence runs the risk of having the benefits of collaboration fall apart.
        Often times the pair will have different levels of experience. In the case where one is an expert and the other is just learning, the expert my assume the role of the driver. The programmer with less experience would likely be observing instead of navigating. In this situation it's still important to stay in
        communication.</p>

        <p>"In summary, driver is the person who has a control of keyboard and focusing on the immediate task of coding."</p>
        <p>"Navigator has tactical role and could see strategic errors such as incorrect direction, wrong methods etc. on coding."</p>
